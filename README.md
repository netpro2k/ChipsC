This is a ["Chips Challenge"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip's_Challenge) clone I made back when I was 15. Dug it up and got it compiling for the mac (had to modify my directory separators and my texture loading code as I was using windows-specific functions for these), but other then that works just as well as it used to, crude developer artwork and all. 

I only ever got around to making 2 levels for it, and never implemented the full chips challenge tileset, but still, this brings back fond memories.

**To run:**

Build using the xcode project and copy the _Levels_ folder, _PLAYER.BMP_, and _Tiles.bmp_ (not sure why I was so inconstant with case back then) to the output directory, and then run.
